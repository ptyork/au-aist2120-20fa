    "# Exam 2 Study Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "First a note. Though this exam is comprehensive, you won't be explicitly \"retested\" on most of the Exam 1 stuff. But, this exam builds on the basics. So you will still need to understand and work with branching and looping constructs. Likewise, you'll need to know basic arithmetic operators (yes, even including '//' and '%').\n",
    "\n",
    "The remainder of this guide covers the \"new\" or \"enhanced\" topics that will be covered.\n",
    "\n",
    "## HOW to Study\n",
    "\n",
    "Though studying by \"answering\" a study guide is certainly not going to hurt, the exam questions are almost ALL geared such that if you know how to CODE the stuff we've been doing, you'll pretty easily pass. The study guide is truly just intended to GUIDE you in the areas that you should focus on. But when it says you should be able to do or recognize or whatever, it's saying that you will be expected to write or interpret code. And the ONLY way you can study for this is to actually write code. From scratch. NOT copy paste from a book or read code from a book or read the code from an example or... No, you need to actually DO the stuff.\n",
    "\n",
    "Look in the book for an example project, but take the IDEA and write the code yourself. Use the command line to do everything related to this exercise, from creating a project folder to opening VS code to executing and testing (SOOOOO IMPORATNT) your code. If you had to \"cheat\" and see what the \"answer\" was, then you didn't learn it. Do another one. If you run out of ones from the book, look online. Or come up with similar ideas on your own. Once the concepts really \"click,\" you can pretty quickly do these kinds of exercises WITHOUT \"cheating.\" Obviously if you never get there, well, an A's an unlikely outcome since that indicates \"mastery\" (at least at a given skill level). But do your best. Honestly, my questions don't even presume \"mastery.\" MOST just presume basic understanding, familiarity and/or competence."
